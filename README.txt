Caleb Goertel - Assignment 3

To run this code, it must first be checked out via git or downloaded from:

https://github.com/cgu11/gtmlassignment3

where it will be publicly available until the grade is returned. 


From there, with requisite packages installed (matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, pandas, jupyter notebooks, seaborn), opening
each notebook and running them straight through will reproduce the models, outputs and charts discussed in the report.

Files clustering.py, dataload.py, dimension_reduction.py, nn.py, and plotting_utils.py are scripts housing 
helper functions and do not need to be run directly, they will be imported by the notebooks.

Datasets used must be placed in the same directory, and can be found at these URLS:

Binary Classification - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult (Download adult.data)
Multi Class Classification - https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yeast (download agarius-lepeota.data, rename to yeast.csv)
